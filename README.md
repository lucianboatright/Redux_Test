# Simple Light weight Redux test framework
Learning how to use redux again, building a light weight framwork counter. 

## Points to remember 
State and task stored in App or Root level.
Counter is fed by the connect(mapStateToProps) which connects to the reducer in App level.
state is imutable so dont change but over write with + 1 or -1
